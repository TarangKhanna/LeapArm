LeapArm
=======
The goal of this project was to understand how to use the leap motion sensor with the arduino and robotic arm I had lying around. I use the Arduino mega for controlling the servos on the robotic arm. 
The code consists of two parts- processing IDE and arduino IDE. 
Parts used:

1)Leap motion sensor 

2)Arduino Mega 2560

3)Robotic arm with 4 Degrees of freedom.
